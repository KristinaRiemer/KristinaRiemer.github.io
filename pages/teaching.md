description: Kristina Riemer's teaching experiences
---

I am an experienced instructor in computational skills, including programming, version control, and data management. I focus specifically on teaching other researchers these skillsets, which enable them to have more reproducible, accurate, and automated research workflows. I have also contributed to openly available materials for teaching this content.
