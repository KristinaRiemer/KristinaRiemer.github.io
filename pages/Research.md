### Undergraduate & Postgraduate Research

**Rotifer behavior**

For my undergraduate honors project, I determined the diel vertical migration patterns of rotifers in a lake in northern Minnesota, and its relationship to an invertebrate predator. [thesis paper](http://lux.lawrence.edu/luhp/16/)

**Fish experimental studies**

I spent time during and after my bachelor's degree at Oak Ridge National Laboratory studying the effect of magnetic fields on fish behavior. I set up both lab and mesocosm experiments and collected data on fish movement and startle responses. 

**Cyanobacterial toxins**

We assessed concentrations of microcystin in Green Bay, and corresponding correlations with environmental variables and algae abundance.
